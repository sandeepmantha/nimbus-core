/**
 * <p> {@link StyleConditional} is an extension capability provided by the
 * framework. The annotation is used to conditionally set the style property on
 * the param represented by the decorated field based on a SpEL condition. The
 * Framework provides default event handling for this annotation during the
 * {@link OnStateLoad} and {@link OnStateChange} events.
 * 
 * <p> The following sample code shows how to configure a field using
 * {@link StyleConditional} by setting the style property of the param
 * represented by {@code nickname} based on the state of
 * {@code shouldUseNickname}.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;GridColumn
 * &#64;Path
 * private String nickname;
 * 
 * &#64;GridColumn(hidden = true)
 * &#64;Path
 * &#64;StyleConditional(targetPath = "/../nickname", condition = {
 * 		&#64;StyleConditional.Condition(when = "state == true", then = &#64;Style(cssClass = "preferred")) })
 * private boolean shouldUseNickname;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>In this scenario, when {@code shouldUseNickname} is {@code true},
 * {@code nickname} will have the css class "preferred" added in the final HTML
 * rendering of the &#64;GridColumn component. For example, assume the value of
 * {@code shouldUseNickname} is {@code true} and the state of {@code nickname}
 * is {@code "Bob"}, then something similar the following would be rendered:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &lt;span title="Bob" class="ng-star-inserted"&gt;
 *   &lt;span class="fieldValue nickname preferred"&gt;Bob&lt;/span&gt;
 * &lt;/span&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Each view component has it's own rules that specify where in the HTML
 * structure the attributes contained within &#64;Style will be written to. See
 * the UI documentation or the final rendered HTML for more information.
 * 
 * <p> This annotation can be triggered for multiple events by providing one or
 * more {@link Condition} annotations within {@code targetPath} and/or multiple
 * {@link StyleConditional} annotations.
